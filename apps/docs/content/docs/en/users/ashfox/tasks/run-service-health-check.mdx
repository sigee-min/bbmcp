# Run Service Health Checks

## Purpose
Detect operational drift before release or deployment updates.

## Prerequisites
- Repository dependencies are installed (`npm install`).
- Required services (gateway/worker or target environment) are running.
- MCP endpoint is reachable from your client/network environment.

## Quick Start
1. Execute repository quality gates (`npm run quality`).
2. Run docs quality checks (`npm run docs:quality`).
3. Build docs static output (`npm --workspace apps/docs run build`).

## Detailed Steps
1. Execute repository quality gates (`npm run quality`).
2. Run docs quality checks (`npm run docs:quality`).
3. Build docs static output (`npm --workspace apps/docs run build`).
4. Confirm static policy gates (`npm run quality:check`).

## Failure and Recovery
- Connection failure: verify endpoint path, service status, and firewall/permission settings.
- Schema error: retry with the minimal request and refresh client schema cache.
- Validation failure: resolve reported findings, then re-run from Quick Start.
