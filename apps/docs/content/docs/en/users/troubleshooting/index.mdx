Troubleshooting is most effective when you classify the failure first and only then apply fixes. This section is organized by failure domain so that connection issues, revision conflicts, validation errors, and schema drift can be handled with targeted steps instead of broad guesswork.

When a call fails, identify whether the failure happened before a tool executed, during mutation, or at validation/export time. That distinction will usually point you directly to one of the pages below.
