# Run Modeling and Texture Iteration

## Purpose
Iterate asset geometry and textures quickly with repeatable tool calls.

## Prerequisites
- Blockbench is installed and can load local plugins.
- Plugin bundle is built from repository root (`npm run build:plugin-desktop`).
- MCP endpoint path (`/mcp`) is configured in plugin settings.

## Quick Start
1. Ensure project context is initialized (`project.ensure_project`).
2. Apply modeling changes (`add_*`, `update_*`, `delete_*` model tools).
3. Read and assign textures (`read_texture`, `assign_texture`).

## Detailed Steps
1. Ensure project context is initialized (`project.ensure_project`).
2. Apply modeling changes (`add_*`, `update_*`, `delete_*` model tools).
3. Read and assign textures (`read_texture`, `assign_texture`).
4. Preview and inspect intermediate result (`project.render_preview`).

## Failure and Recovery
- Connection failure: verify endpoint path, service status, and firewall/permission settings.
- Schema error: retry with the minimal request and refresh client schema cache.
- Validation failure: resolve reported findings, then re-run from Quick Start.
