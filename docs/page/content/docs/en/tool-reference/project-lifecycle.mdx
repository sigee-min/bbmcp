## Setup and State

- `ensure_project`: create/select/delete active project.
- `get_project_state`: read current revision, structure, and summary/full state.

## Quality Gates

- `validate`: run structural, capability, and texture checks.
- `render_preview`: generate visual snapshots before release.

## Output and Logs

- `export`: output production artifact (for example, `.bbmodel` JSON).
- `export_trace_log`: capture operation history for debugging and QA reports.

## Typical Sequence

1. `ensure_project`
2. `get_project_state`
3. mutation calls with `ifRevision`
4. `validate`
5. `render_preview`
6. `export`
