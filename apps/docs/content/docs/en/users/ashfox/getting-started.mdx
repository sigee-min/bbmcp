## Goal

Verify service readiness, endpoint reachability, and basic client interoperability.

## First operational flow

1. Start gateway and worker services.
2. Confirm endpoint path and network reachability.
3. Call `system.list_capabilities` from an external client.
4. Run one read-only project call.
5. Run one revision-safe mutation and check response handling.

After this baseline, move to the Ashfox workflow guide and task playbooks.
