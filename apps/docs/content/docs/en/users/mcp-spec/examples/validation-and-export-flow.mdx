# Validation and Export Flow

## Flow

1. Run validation (`project.validate`).
2. Resolve findings and re-run until no blocking issues remain.
3. Export artifact (`project.export`).
4. Export trace logs for audit (`project.export_trace_log`).

## UX Notes

- Keep findings grouped by severity and location.
- Include remediation hints in UI when possible.
