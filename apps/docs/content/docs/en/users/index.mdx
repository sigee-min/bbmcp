summary: "Choose your track first, then follow track-specific installation and workflow guidance."

User docs are organized around two real usage tracks. Pick the track that matches your environment first, then complete its installation and workflow guide before jumping into task playbooks.

## Recommended reading order

1. Choose `Blockbench Plugin` or `Ashfox`.
2. Complete the selected track's `Installation`.
3. Read the selected track's `Getting Started` and `Workflow Guide`.
4. Execute concrete operations in each track's `Task Playbooks`.
5. Use `Tool Reference` and `Troubleshooting` for detailed implementation and incident response.
