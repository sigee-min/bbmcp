## Quick Summary
Flushes the trace log to disk (writeFile/export) and returns the resource URI for the in-memory log.

## Overview
- Tool name: `export_trace_log`
- Category: Project
- Strict schema: `true`

## Tool Description
Flushes the trace log to disk (writeFile/export) and returns the resource URI for the in-memory log.

## Input Schema (JSON)
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "properties": {
    "mode": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": [
        "auto",
        "writeFile",
        "export"
      ]
    },
    "destPath": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "fileName": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  }
}
```

## Field Reference
| Field | Type | Required | Description | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mode` | `enum("auto", "writeFile", "export")` | ❌ | Selects how the tool executes this request. | enum: "auto", "writeFile", "export" |
| `destPath` | `string` | ❌ | Destination path for writing output artifacts. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |
| `fileName` | `string` | ❌ | Output file name used when exporting. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |

## Minimal Request Example
```json
{}
```

## Response Example
This response is a schematic example. Actual values and optional fields vary by project state and runtime version.

```json
{
  "structuredContent": {}
}
```

## Operational Notes
- Send only fields declared in the input schema.
- Treat response examples as schematic and handle optional fields defensively.
- This tool is read-only, so `ifRevision` is usually unnecessary.
