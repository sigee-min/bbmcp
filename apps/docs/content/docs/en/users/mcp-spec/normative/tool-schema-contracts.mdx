# Tool Schema Contracts

## MUST

- Preserve required field names and semantic meaning for existing tools.
- Reject invalid payloads with clear validation findings.
- Keep enum and discriminator values stable once published.

## SHOULD

- Add new optional fields instead of changing required fields.
- Document compatibility impact before introducing new strict constraints.
