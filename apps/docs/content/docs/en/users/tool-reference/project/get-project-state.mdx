## Quick Summary
Returns the current project state (summary by default). Summary includes texture metadata and textureResolution. Full detail includes textureUsage (per-face mappings) when available.

## Overview
- Tool name: `get_project_state`
- Category: Project
- Strict schema: `true`

## Tool Description
Returns the current project state (summary by default). Summary includes texture metadata and textureResolution. Full detail includes textureUsage (per-face mappings) when available.

## Input Schema (JSON)
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "properties": {
    "detail": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": [
        "summary",
        "full"
      ]
    },
    "includeUsage": {
      "type": "boolean",
      "description": "Include textureUsage in the response (defaults to true when detail=full)."
    }
  }
}
```

## Field Reference
| Field | Type | Required | Description | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `detail` | `enum("summary", "full")` | ❌ | Controls response detail level. | enum: "summary", "full" |
| `includeUsage` | `boolean` | ❌ | Include textureUsage in the response (defaults to true when detail=full). | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |

## Minimal Request Example
```json
{}
```

## Response Example
This response is a schematic example. Actual values and optional fields vary by project state and runtime version.

```json
{
  "structuredContent": {
    "project": {
      "id": "value",
      "active": false,
      "name": "value",
      "format": "Java Block/Item",
      "revision": "value",
      "counts": {
        "bones": 0,
        "cubes": 0,
        "textures": 0,
        "animations": 0
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Operational Notes
- Send only fields declared in the input schema.
- Treat response examples as schematic and handle optional fields defensively.
- This tool is read-only, so `ifRevision` is usually unnecessary.
