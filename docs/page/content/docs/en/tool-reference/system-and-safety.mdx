## Capability and Runtime

- `list_capabilities`: read supported tools, payload schemas, and limits.
- `reload_plugins`: reload Blockbench plugins when runtime state needs reset.

## Safety Pattern

1. Read revision via `get_project_state`.
2. Send mutation with `ifRevision`.
3. Re-read revision after success.
4. Run `validate` before export.

## Client Robustness

- Cache schemas by `toolRegistry.hash`.
- Refresh cache immediately when hash changes.
- Reject or strip unsupported extra payload fields on client side.
