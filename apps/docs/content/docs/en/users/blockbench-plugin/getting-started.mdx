## Goal

Confirm that plugin install, endpoint configuration, and first MCP calls all work in one local session.

## First session flow

1. Load plugin bundle in Blockbench.
2. Configure endpoint path to `/mcp`.
3. Run `system.list_capabilities`.
4. Run one project read call such as `get_project_state`.
5. Run one safe mutation with `ifRevision`, then `validate`.

If the sequence succeeds end-to-end, continue to workflow and task playbooks.
