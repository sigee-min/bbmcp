# Export and Validate Release Candidate

## Purpose
Run validation gates and export artifacts that are ready for handoff.

## Prerequisites
- Blockbench is installed and can load local plugins.
- Plugin bundle is built from repository root (`npm run build:plugin-desktop`).
- MCP endpoint path (`/mcp`) is configured in plugin settings.

## Quick Start
1. Run model checks with `project.validate`.
2. Resolve findings and re-run validation until clean.
3. Export output with `project.export`.

## Detailed Steps
1. Run model checks with `project.validate`.
2. Resolve findings and re-run validation until clean.
3. Export output with `project.export`.
4. Save trace log for auditability (`project.export_trace_log`).

## Failure and Recovery
- Connection failure: verify endpoint path, service status, and firewall/permission settings.
- Schema error: retry with the minimal request and refresh client schema cache.
- Validation failure: resolve reported findings, then re-run from Quick Start.
