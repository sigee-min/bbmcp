## Endpoint Not Reachable

1. Confirm Blockbench is running with bbmcp loaded.
2. Verify endpoint URL is correct (`http://127.0.0.1:8787/mcp` by default).
3. Check custom settings: `BBMCP_HOST`, `BBMCP_PORT`, `BBMCP_PATH`.

## Quick Check

- Call `list_capabilities`.
- If it fails, connectivity is still broken before tool-level execution.
