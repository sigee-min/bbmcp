## Quick Summary
Validates the current project.

## Overview
- Tool name: `validate`
- Category: Project
- Strict schema: `true`

## Tool Description
Validates the current project.

## Input Schema (JSON)
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "properties": {
    "includeState": {
      "type": "boolean"
    },
    "ifRevision": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  }
}
```

## Field Reference
| Field | Type | Required | Description | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `includeState` | `boolean` | ❌ | Includes the latest project snapshot in the response. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |
| `ifRevision` | `string` | ❌ | Optimistic concurrency token used to avoid stale writes. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |

## Minimal Request Example
```json
{}
```

## Response Example
This response is a schematic example. Actual values and optional fields vary by project state and runtime version.

```json
{
  "structuredContent": {
    "findings": [
      {
        "code": "value",
        "message": "value",
        "severity": "error"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Operational Notes
- Send only fields declared in the input schema.
- Treat response examples as schematic and handle optional fields defensively.
- This tool is read-only, so `ifRevision` is usually unnecessary.
