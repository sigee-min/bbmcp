## Quick Summary
Returns plugin capabilities and limits. Tool schemas are strict (extra fields are rejected).

## Overview
- Tool name: `list_capabilities`
- Category: System
- Strict schema: `true`

## Tool Description
Returns plugin capabilities and limits. Tool schemas are strict (extra fields are rejected).

## Input Schema (JSON)
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

## Field Reference
This tool has no input fields.

## Minimal Request Example
```json
{}
```

## Response Example
This response is a schematic example. Actual values and optional fields vary by project state and runtime version.

```json
{
  "structuredContent": {
    "pluginVersion": "value",
    "blockbenchVersion": "value",
    "formats": [
      {
        "format": "Java Block/Item",
        "animations": false,
        "enabled": false
      }
    ],
    "limits": {
      "maxCubes": 0,
      "maxTextureSize": 0,
      "maxAnimationSeconds": 0
    }
  }
}
```

## Operational Notes
- Send only fields declared in the input schema.
- Treat response examples as schematic and handle optional fields defensively.
- This tool is read-only, so `ifRevision` is usually unnecessary.
