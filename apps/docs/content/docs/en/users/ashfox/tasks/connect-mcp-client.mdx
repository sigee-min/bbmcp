# Connect External MCP Client

## Purpose
Establish stable MCP connectivity from non-Blockbench clients.

## Prerequisites
- Repository dependencies are installed (`npm install`).
- Required services (gateway/worker or target environment) are running.
- MCP endpoint is reachable from your client/network environment.

## Quick Start
1. Confirm gateway endpoint path and authentication assumptions.
2. Execute handshake and capability discovery (`system.list_capabilities`).
3. Run one read-only project call to verify payload path.

## Detailed Steps
1. Confirm gateway endpoint path and authentication assumptions.
2. Execute handshake and capability discovery (`system.list_capabilities`).
3. Run one read-only project call to verify payload path.
4. Validate error mapping and retry behavior in client logs.

## Failure and Recovery
- Connection failure: verify endpoint path, service status, and firewall/permission settings.
- Schema error: retry with the minimal request and refresh client schema cache.
- Validation failure: resolve reported findings, then re-run from Quick Start.
