## Field Reference
| Field | Type | Required | Description | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` | ❌ | Specifies the unique target id for this operation. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |
| `name` | `string` | ✅ | Specifies the target name used for matching. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |
| `length` | `number` | ✅ | Request parameter `length`. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |
| `loop` | `boolean` | ✅ | Request parameter `loop`. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |
| `fps` | `number` | ✅ | Request parameter `fps`. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |
| `ifRevision` | `string` | ❌ | Optimistic concurrency token used to avoid stale writes. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |
| `includeState` | `boolean` | ❌ | Includes the latest project snapshot in the response. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |
| `includeDiff` | `boolean` | ❌ | Includes revision diff data in the response. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |
| `diffDetail` | `enum("summary", "full")` | ❌ | Controls diff verbosity when diff data is included. | enum: "summary", "full" |

## Minimal Request Example
```json
{
  "name": "clip",
  "length": 1,
  "loop": true,
  "fps": 20
}
```

## Response Example
This response is a schematic example. Actual values and optional fields vary by project state and runtime version.

```json
{
  "structuredContent": {
    "id": "value",
    "name": "value"
  }
}
```

## Operational Notes
- Send only fields declared in the input schema.
- Treat response examples as schematic and handle optional fields defensively.
- For mutating tools, use `ifRevision` when the tool supports it.
