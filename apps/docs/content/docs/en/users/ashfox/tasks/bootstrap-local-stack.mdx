# Bootstrap Local Service Stack

## Purpose
Bring up the Ashfox service stack locally with predictable startup order.

## Prerequisites
- Repository dependencies are installed (`npm install`).
- Required services (gateway/worker or target environment) are running.
- MCP endpoint is reachable from your client/network environment.

## Quick Start
1. Install dependencies at repository root (`npm install`).
2. Build required packages (`npm run build`, `npm --workspace @ashfox/web run build`).
3. Start gateway and worker services.

## Detailed Steps
1. Install dependencies at repository root (`npm install`).
2. Build required packages (`npm run build`, `npm --workspace @ashfox/web run build`).
3. Start gateway and worker services.
4. Validate endpoint reachability from an external client.

## Failure and Recovery
- Connection failure: verify endpoint path, service status, and firewall/permission settings.
- Schema error: retry with the minimal request and refresh client schema cache.
- Validation failure: resolve reported findings, then re-run from Quick Start.
