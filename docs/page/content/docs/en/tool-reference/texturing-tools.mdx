## Core Texture Operations

- `assign_texture`: bind texture to selected cubes/faces.
- `paint_faces`: paint cube faces with rectangle/line/fill operations.
- `paint_mesh_face`: paint mesh UV faces with rectangle/line/fill operations.
- `read_texture`: inspect current texture image and metadata.
- `delete_texture`: remove texture from project.

## `paint_mesh_face` Scope

- `scope: "single_face"`: paint exactly one mesh face (`target.faceId` required).
- `scope: "all_faces"`: paint all paintable faces on the mesh (`target.faceId` must be omitted).
- If `scope` is omitted, bbmcp infers it from `target.faceId`:
  - `faceId` present -> `single_face`
  - `faceId` absent -> `all_faces`

## Preview and Checks

- Use `render_preview` after texture edits for quick visual QA.
- Use `validate` before export to catch texture usage issues.

## Texturing Practices

- Keep painting operations atomic and intentional.
- Prefer incremental paint calls over large opaque updates.
- Re-run `read_texture` when verifying edge-case face mapping.
