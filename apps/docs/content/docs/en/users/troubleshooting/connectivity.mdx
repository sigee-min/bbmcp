## Endpoint Not Reachable

1. Confirm Blockbench is running with Ashfox loaded.
2. Verify endpoint URL is correct (`http://127.0.0.1:8787/mcp` by default).
3. Check custom settings: `ASHFOX_HOST`, `ASHFOX_PORT`, `ASHFOX_PATH`.

## Quick Check

- Call `list_capabilities`.
- If it fails, connectivity is still broken before tool-level execution.
