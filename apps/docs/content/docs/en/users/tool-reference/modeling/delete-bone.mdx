## Field Reference
| Field | Type | Required | Description | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` | ❌ | Specifies the unique target id for this operation. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |
| `name` | `string` | ❌ | Specifies the target name used for matching. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |
| `ids` | `array<string>` | ❌ | Specifies multiple target ids for batch operation. | minItems: 1 |
| `names` | `array<string>` | ❌ | Specifies multiple target names for batch operation. | minItems: 1 |
| `ifRevision` | `string` | ❌ | Optimistic concurrency token used to avoid stale writes. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |
| `includeState` | `boolean` | ❌ | Includes the latest project snapshot in the response. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |
| `includeDiff` | `boolean` | ❌ | Includes revision diff data in the response. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |
| `diffDetail` | `enum("summary", "full")` | ❌ | Controls diff verbosity when diff data is included. | enum: "summary", "full" |

## Minimal Request Example
```json
{
  "name": "bone"
}
```

## Response Example
This response is a schematic example. Actual values and optional fields vary by project state and runtime version.

```json
{
  "structuredContent": {
    "id": "value",
    "name": "value",
    "removedBones": 0,
    "removedCubes": 0,
    "deleted": [
      {
        "name": "value"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Operational Notes
- Send only fields declared in the input schema.
- Treat response examples as schematic and handle optional fields defensively.
- For mutating tools, use `ifRevision` when the tool supports it.
