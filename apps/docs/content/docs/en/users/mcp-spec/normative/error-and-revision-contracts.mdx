# Error and Revision Contracts

## MUST

- Enforce revision guards for mutation commands.
- Return machine-parseable findings for validation failures.
- Keep concurrent-write failures distinguishable from payload errors.

## SHOULD

- Provide suggested next actions on conflict failures.
- Preserve trace-log correlation keys across retries.
