# Client Session Flow

## Flow

1. Discover capabilities (`system.list_capabilities`).
2. Ensure project context (`project.ensure_project`).
3. Execute one read operation (for baseline connectivity).
4. Execute first mutation with revision guard.

## UX Notes

- Surface capability list and unavailable tools early.
- Keep retry guidance next to network/concurrency failures.
