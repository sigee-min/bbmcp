description: First-run flow for ashfox MCP tools, from connection to validated export.
---

## TL;DR

1. Run Blockbench with the ashfox plugin enabled.
2. Connect your MCP client to `http://127.0.0.1:8787/mcp`.
3. Run `list_capabilities` to load current schemas and limits.
4. Execute: `ensure_project` -> `add_bone`/`add_cube` -> `validate` -> `export`.

## First Session Checklist

- Blockbench desktop is running and ashfox is loaded.
- MCP endpoint is reachable (`/mcp`).
- `list_capabilities` returns tool schemas and `toolRegistry.hash`.
- `get_project_state` returns an initial project revision.

## Minimal Operational Flow

1. Start with `ensure_project` to attach or create a project.
2. Read revision via `get_project_state`.
3. Run mutation tools with `ifRevision` to prevent stale writes.
4. Execute `validate` to catch structure/capability issues.
5. Review output with `render_preview`.
6. Finalize with `export`.

## Recommended Next Step

- Read `Tool Reference` for tool categories and sequencing strategy.
