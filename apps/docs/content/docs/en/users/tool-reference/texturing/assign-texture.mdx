## Field Reference
| Field | Type | Required | Description | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `textureId` | `string` | ❌ | Request parameter `textureId`. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |
| `textureName` | `string` | ❌ | Request parameter `textureName`. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |
| `cubeIds` | `array<string>` | ❌ | Limit to these cube ids. If cubeNames is also provided, both must match. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |
| `cubeNames` | `array<string>` | ❌ | Limit to these cube names. If cubeIds is also provided, both must match. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |
| `faces` | `array<enum("north", "south", "east", "west", "up", "down")>` | ❌ | Request parameter `faces`. | minItems: 1 |
| `ifRevision` | `string` | ❌ | Optimistic concurrency token used to avoid stale writes. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |
| `includeState` | `boolean` | ❌ | Includes the latest project snapshot in the response. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |
| `includeDiff` | `boolean` | ❌ | Includes revision diff data in the response. | No extra constraints beyond the declared type. |
| `diffDetail` | `enum("summary", "full")` | ❌ | Controls diff verbosity when diff data is included. | enum: "summary", "full" |

## Minimal Request Example
```json
{
  "textureName": "texture",
  "cubeNames": [
    "cube"
  ]
}
```

## Response Example
This response is a schematic example. Actual values and optional fields vary by project state and runtime version.

```json
{
  "structuredContent": {
    "textureName": "value",
    "cubeCount": 0
  }
}
```

## Operational Notes
- Send only fields declared in the input schema.
- Treat response examples as schematic and handle optional fields defensively.
- For mutating tools, use `ifRevision` when the tool supports it.
