title: Revision and Concurrency
description: Resolve stale-write and concurrent mutation issues safely.
---

## Symptoms

- Mutation tools reject request with revision/state mismatch.
- Concurrent clients overwrite each other.

## Recovery Flow

1. Call `get_project_state` and read latest `revision`.
2. Re-run mutation with `ifRevision` set to that revision.
3. After success, fetch new revision before next mutation.

## Prevention

- Never batch many mutable operations without revision refresh points.
- Keep mutation operations small and explicit.
