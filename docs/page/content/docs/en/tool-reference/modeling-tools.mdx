description: Bone, cube, and mesh tools for deterministic model edits.

## Bone Tools

- `add_bone`
- `update_bone`
- `delete_bone`

Use these to manage hierarchy, pivot, rotation, scale, and visibility.

## Cube Tools

- `add_cube`
- `update_cube`
- `delete_cube`

Use cube tools for box-based geometry, with explicit transforms and optional reassignment to other bones.

## Mesh Tools

- `add_mesh`
- `update_mesh`
- `delete_mesh`

Use mesh tools for non-cube geometry and controlled uv policies.

## Modeling Practices

- Apply one clear geometry change per call.
- Re-read revision after each successful mutation.
- Validate frequently during complex edits.
