title: Validation and Export
description: Fix validation failures and incorrect export outcomes.

## Validation Fails

1. Run `validate` and inspect the reported issue type.
2. Correct with specific tools (`update_*`, texture tools, animation updates).
3. Re-run `validate` until clean.

## Export Looks Wrong

1. Run `render_preview` to inspect current state before export.
2. Use `read_texture` when texture issues are suspected.
3. Export again only after validation passes.
